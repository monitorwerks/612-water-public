    612Water is the water store for everyone who believes that great water
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take water production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to

        We believe that good water has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow water lovers and learn about
        water making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our water to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the water’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
